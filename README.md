## safety-razer

Ever accidentally run a command as `root`? `safety-razer` helps keep you aware of when you're logged in as `root` by setting every Razer device's lighting effect to a deep red. When you exit from `root`, it will set the lighting effect to a calm blue. 

#### Usage

```
$ git clone https://github.com/alichtman/safety-razer
$ cd safety-razer
$ python3 safety-razer &  # The "&" runs this as a background process
```
